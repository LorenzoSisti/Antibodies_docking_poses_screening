<!-- This is a RosettaScripts XML file that defines a protocol to calculate the shape complementarity
between an antibody and its antigen using the ShapeComplementarity function.

The antibody is defined as residues in chains 'H' or 'L', while anything else is considered the antigen.-->

<ROSETTASCRIPTS>

<!-- To select the residues, I specify that the antibody chain must be named 'H' or 'L'.
Anything that is not H or L will be considered the antigen. -->

	<RESIDUE_SELECTORS>
        <Chain name="heavy" chains="H"/>
        <Chain name="light" chains="L"/>
        <Or name="antibody" selectors="heavy,light"/>
        <Not name="antigen">
            <Chain chains="H,L"/>
        </Not>
	</RESIDUE_SELECTORS>

<!-- The ShapeComplementarity function calculates the shape complementarity between two residue selections.
It belongs to the 'FILTERS' category in RosettaScripts. -->

	<FILTERS>
        <ShapeComplementarity name="sc" residue_selector1="antibody" residue_selector2="antigen" write_int_area="TRUE"/>   
	</FILTERS>

	<PROTOCOLS>
        <Add filter="sc" /> <!-- This will add the filter to the protocol -->
	</PROTOCOLS>
	<OUTPUT />
